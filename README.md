# pdvps

PNG Data Vehicle for Twitter, PowerShell Edition (PDVPS).

Embed any file of up to â‰ˆ5MB within a tweetable and '*executable*' PNG polyglot image.

Works for both Windows and *Linux. 

(*PowerShell required).

PDVPS is similar to my other program [***pdvzip***](https://github.com/CleasbyCode/pdvzip), the two main differences in this **pdv** edition are **1).** It is supplied with a default PNG image that you use to embed your file. The image file is small in size, which maximises the amount of data you can embed (5,234,608 bytes, almost 5MB), it also substantially reduces the required C++ code of the main program. **2).** There is an embedded PowerShell script within this default PNG image that is used to extract and open/play/run (depending on media type) your embedded file. This eliminates the need to use an external unzip tool. 

This program is really just an amateurish experiment of mine in testing if I could make some use of PowerShell code embedded within a PNG image.

For more information on the embedded scripts within the default PNG image, see **scripts_info.txt** file supplied with this repo.

For information about image settings and arbitary data preservation for Twitter, visit [***pdvzip***](https://github.com/CleasbyCode/pdvzip#png-image-requirements-for-arbitrary-data-preservation).

Always use file extensions for your data file: my_doc.pdf, my_video.mp4, my_program.py, etc. A filename without an extension will be considered an '.exe' file.

Compile and run the program under Windows or **Linux**.

## Usage (Linux)

```c
$ g++ pdvps.cpp -w -o pdvps
$
$ ./pdvps

Usage:  pdvps  <your_file>
        pdvps  --info

```

Once your file has been embedded within the PNG image, it's ready to be shared (tweeted) or '*executed*' whenever you want to extract and open/play/run (depending on media type) your embedded file.

You can also upload and share the PNG image to *some popular image hosting sites, such as [***Flickr***](https://www.flickr.com/), [***ImgBB***](https://imgbb.com/), [***Imgur***](https://imgur.com/a/zF40QMX), [***ImgPile***](https://imgpile.com/), [***ImageShack***](https://imageshack.com/), [***PostImage***](https://postimg.cc/xcCcvpLJ), etc. **Not all image hosting sites are compatible, e.g. [***ImgBox***](https://imgbox.com/), [***Reddit***](https://www.reddit.com/).*

## Extracting Your File From the PNG Image
**Linux (PowerShell required)**    
Make sure image file has executable permissions.
```c

$ chmod +x pdv_image_file.png
$
$ ./pdv_image_file.png 

```  
**Windows**   
First, rename the '*.png*' file extension to '*.cmd*'.
```c

G:\demo> ren pdv_image_file.png pdv_image_file.cmd
G:\demo>
G:\demo> .\pdv_image_file.cmd

```

**Image Example**  

[Twitter. Image is embedded with an MP4 video file. Click the image to fully expand it, then
  right-click image, select "Save image as..." from menu. Run image as per instructions above. ](https://twitter.com/CleasbyCode/status/1579418557762322432)

**Video Example (YouTube)**
[YouTube. Linux demo of pdvps embedding a PDF document within the PNG Image, then running the image file
  to extract and display the PDF document. Followed by Tweeting the PNG Image and saving it to a Windows
  machine, where we run it again to extract and display the PDF document on Windows.](https://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=19hi4_UFICI)
