The PNG image file is the barebones image (6.81 KB) that contains the Linux shell / Windows batch and PowerShell scripts. 
(see scripts_info.txt, in the main folder for more information on these embedded scripts).

The C++ program uses this image (Image_with_Scripts_Vec.hpp) to update the relevant parts of the main PowerShell script that's
embedded within it and to insert your data file.
